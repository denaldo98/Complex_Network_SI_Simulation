Analysis of a SI epidemic spreading in a dynamic complex network ("communication network of the Linux kernel mailing list"):

- Analysis and study of the network (descriptors, plots, distributions, communities)

- Study infection propagation starting from specific nodes and perform comparisons

- Analyze time of infection of the nodes,

- Speed of epidemic spreding for different initial infected node (and infection probabilities)

- Study time to infect specific nodes,

-Analyze possibility to immunitize some nodes or reduce their infection probabilities

- (possibly develop also a SIR epidemic spreading model)


1- create another file with lines ordered by timestamp
2- create compressed network file with node1, node2, weight(equal to num of links)






1- Plot of the network
2- Find centralities and sorted plots
3- Average simulations
4- Store time of infection of each node
5- X axis put time in seconds after first infection


Last list :
- p=1
- Effect of p on mean infection time
- Effect of seed nodes on rho(t)
- Correlation study on median infection time of each node (different seeds for each it):
    - Clustering
    - Degree
    - Different centrality measures
    - Strengh
-
